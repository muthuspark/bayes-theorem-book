## Introduction to Bayesian Neural Networks

### Why Bayesian Neural Networks?

Standard, or frequentist, neural networks treat the network weights as fixed parameters to be estimated.  The training process aims to find a single "best" set of weights that minimizes a loss function on the training data. This approach suffers from several limitations, as we'll discuss below.  Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), in contrast, treat the network weights as random variables with probability distributions. This allows us to quantify the uncertainty in our model's predictions, a crucial advantage in many real-world applications.  Instead of a single point estimate for the weights, a BNN provides a posterior distribution over the weights, reflecting our belief about the weights given the observed data. This posterior distribution is then used to make predictions, integrating over all possible weight configurations.  The result is a prediction that incorporates uncertainty, leading to more robust and reliable outcomes, especially in situations with limited data or noisy observations.

### Limitations of Frequentist Neural Networks

Frequentist neural networks have several drawbacks:

* **Overfitting:**  They can easily overfit the training data, performing well on the training set but poorly on unseen data.  The single point estimate of the weights can be highly sensitive to the specific training set.
* **Lack of Uncertainty Quantification:**  They provide no inherent measure of the uncertainty associated with their predictions.  A confident prediction might be completely wrong, and there's no way to know from the model itself.
* **Model Selection Difficulty:** Choosing the optimal architecture (number of layers, neurons, etc.) and hyperparameters requires extensive experimentation and cross-validation.  There is no principled way to compare models based solely on their test set performance.

### Bayesian Framework: Prior, Likelihood, Posterior

The core of a BNN is the Bayesian approach to inference. We use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about the network weights given the observed data:

$P(\mathbf{w}|D) = \frac{P(D|\mathbf{w})P(\mathbf{w})}{P(D)}$

where:

* $\mathbf{w}$ represents the vector of network weights.
* $D$ represents the training data.
* $P(\mathbf{w})$ is the *prior* distribution over the weights, representing our beliefs about the weights *before* seeing the data.  We often choose a prior that reflects our assumptions about the weights (e.g., a Gaussian prior indicating that we expect the weights to be close to zero).
* $P(D|\mathbf{w})$ is the *likelihood*, representing the probability of observing the data given a specific set of weights.  This is determined by the neural network's architecture and the assumed noise model (e.g., Gaussian noise).
* $P(\mathbf{w}|D)$ is the *posterior* distribution, representing our updated beliefs about the weights *after* seeing the data.  This is what we are interested in.
* $P(D)$ is the evidence, the probability of the data. It acts as a normalizing constant.


Calculating the posterior directly is often intractable for complex models like neural networks.  Therefore, we use approximation methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Variational Inference (VI).  MCMC methods generate samples from the posterior distribution, while VI approximates the posterior with a simpler, tractable distribution.

```\{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import norm

# Example: Illustrative prior and likelihood (simplified)

# Prior distribution (Gaussian)
prior_mean = 0
prior_std = 1
prior_x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
prior_y = norm.pdf(prior_x, prior_mean, prior_std)

# Likelihood (Gaussian, assuming some data point around 2)
likelihood_mean = 2
likelihood_std = 0.5
likelihood_x = np.linspace(-1, 5, 100)
likelihood_y = norm.pdf(likelihood_x, likelihood_mean, likelihood_std)

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(prior_x, prior_y, label='Prior')
plt.plot(likelihood_x, likelihood_y, label='Likelihood')

# (Note:  Posterior calculation requires more sophisticated methods like MCMC or VI, 
# which are beyond the scope of this simplified example.  The true posterior would
# be a combination of the prior and likelihood.)

plt.xlabel('Weight Value')
plt.ylabel('Probability Density')
plt.title('Prior and Likelihood Distributions')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This Python code provides a simplified illustration of prior and likelihood distributions.  A full implementation of a BNN would require a much more extensive codebase involving deep learning libraries (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) and MCMC or VI algorithms.  The figure generated shows how the prior beliefs are updated by the observed data (represented by the likelihood).  The true posterior, however, is not explicitly shown here, as its computation is complex and computationally expensive.


## Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks

### Understanding Weight Uncertainty

In frequentist neural networks, the training process aims to find a single "best" set of weights, $\mathbf{w}^*$, that minimizes a loss function.  This $\mathbf{w}^*$ is a point estimate, representing our best guess for the true weights of the network.  However, this point estimate ignores the inherent uncertainty in the model's parameters.  The uncertainty stems from several sources:

* **Limited Data:**  The training data may not fully represent the underlying data distribution, leading to unreliable weight estimates.
* **Model Misspecification:** The chosen neural network architecture might not perfectly capture the true data generating process.
* **Noise in the Data:**  Noise in the training data inevitably leads to uncertainty in the learned weights.

Ignoring this uncertainty can have serious consequences, resulting in overconfident predictions and poor generalization to unseen data.  Bayesian neural networks explicitly address this issue by representing the weights as probability distributions, enabling us to quantify the uncertainty associated with each weight.

### The Problem of Point Estimates

Using a point estimate $\mathbf{w}^*$ for the network weights leads to several problems:

* **Overconfidence:**  The model produces predictions without acknowledging the uncertainty in its parameters. This can lead to overly confident, yet potentially inaccurate, predictions.
* **Poor Generalization:** A point estimate can overfit to the training data, resulting in poor performance on unseen data.  Slight variations in the training set can significantly alter the point estimate, making it unstable and unreliable.
* **Lack of Robustness:**  The model is sensitive to noise and outliers in the training data, as the point estimate is directly affected by these noisy observations.

Consider the following scenario:  A neural network trained on a limited dataset predicts the probability of rain tomorrow as 90%.  A frequentist approach would simply report this 90% without any indication of the uncertainty associated with this estimate. However, if the training data was small or noisy, this 90% might be misleading.  A BNN, on the other hand, would provide a probability distribution over the predicted probability, indicating, for instance, a wide range around 90%, reflecting the uncertainty associated with the prediction.

### Representing Uncertainty with Probability Distributions

Bayesian neural networks represent the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$ as a probability distribution, $P(\mathbf{w})$.  This distribution captures our uncertainty about the true values of the weights.  During training, instead of finding a single point estimate, we aim to learn the posterior distribution $P(\mathbf{w}|D)$, where $D$ represents the training data. This posterior distribution reflects our updated belief about the weights after observing the data.

The posterior distribution can be used to make predictions by integrating over all possible weight configurations:

$P(y|x, D) = \int P(y|x, \mathbf{w}) P(\mathbf{w}|D) d\mathbf{w}$

where:

* $x$ is the input.
* $y$ is the output.
* $P(y|x, \mathbf{w})$ is the likelihood of observing output $y$ given input $x$ and weights $\mathbf{w}$.

This integration process accounts for the uncertainty in the weights, leading to more robust and reliable predictions.  In practice, this integral is often intractable, and we resort to approximation methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Variational Inference (VI) to obtain samples from or approximate the posterior distribution.


```\{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import norm

# Example: Illustrating Weight Uncertainty (simplified)

# Assume we have posterior distributions for two weights, w1 and w2
w1_samples = norm.rvs(loc=0.5, scale=0.2, size=1000) # Mean 0.5, std 0.2
w2_samples = norm.rvs(loc=1.0, scale=0.3, size=1000) # Mean 1.0, std 0.3

# Plot the distributions
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.hist(w1_samples, bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='Weight w1')
plt.hist(w2_samples, bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='Weight w2')
plt.xlabel('Weight Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Posterior Distributions of Weights')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

```

This code generates samples from two Gaussian distributions, representing the posterior distributions for two hypothetical weights in a neural network.  The histograms visualize the uncertainty associated with each weight.  A wider histogram indicates higher uncertainty.  Note that generating these posterior samples requires more complex algorithms within a BNN framework (like MCMC or VI), which this simplified example omits.


## Variational Inference for Bayesian Neural Networks

### Introduction to Variational Inference

Variational inference (VI) is a powerful technique for approximating intractable posterior distributions, like those encountered in Bayesian neural networks.  Instead of directly sampling from the true posterior $P(\mathbf{w}|D)$, VI approximates it with a simpler, tractable distribution $q(\mathbf{w})$.  This simpler distribution is chosen from a family of distributions parameterized by variational parameters $\phi$. The goal is to find the values of $\phi$ that make $q_\phi(\mathbf{w})$ the "best" approximation of $P(\mathbf{w}|D)$.  "Best" is typically defined in terms of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between $q_\phi(\mathbf{w})$ and $P(\mathbf{w}|D)$:

$KL[q_\phi(\mathbf{w}) || P(\mathbf{w}|D)] = \int q_\phi(\mathbf{w}) \log \frac{q_\phi(\mathbf{w})}{P(\mathbf{w}|D)} d\mathbf{w}$

Minimizing this KL divergence is equivalent to maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO).

### Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)

The ELBO is a lower bound on the marginal likelihood (evidence) $P(D)$:

$\log P(D) \ge \mathcal{L}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{w})} [\log P(D, \mathbf{w})] - KL[q_\phi(\mathbf{w}) || P(\mathbf{w})]$

where:

* $\mathcal{L}(\phi)$ is the ELBO, a function of the variational parameters $\phi$.
* $\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(\mathbf{w})} [\log P(D, \mathbf{w})]$ is the expected log-joint probability of the data and weights under the variational distribution.
* $KL[q_\phi(\mathbf{w}) || P(\mathbf{w})]$ is the KL divergence between the variational distribution and the prior distribution.

Maximizing the ELBO is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence between the variational posterior and the true posterior.  This is done by optimizing the variational parameters $\phi$ using gradient-based optimization methods.

### Implementation with Automatic Differentiation

Modern deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic differentiation capabilities that simplify the implementation of VI for BNNs.  The gradients of the ELBO with respect to the variational parameters are computed automatically, allowing for efficient optimization using algorithms like Adam or SGD.  The key steps are:

1. **Define the neural network and the variational distribution:**  This involves specifying the network architecture and choosing a parameterized family of distributions for $q_\phi(\mathbf{w})$ (e.g., Gaussian).
2. **Implement the ELBO:** This involves calculating the expected log-joint probability and the KL divergence.
3. **Compute gradients:** The automatic differentiation capability of the framework is used to compute the gradients of the ELBO with respect to $\phi$.
4. **Optimize the variational parameters:**  A gradient-based optimizer is used to update $\phi$ and maximize the ELBO.

### Choosing Variational Distributions

The choice of the variational distribution $q_\phi(\mathbf{w})$ is crucial.  Common choices include:

* **Mean-field approximation:**  This assumes that the weights are independent, so $q_\phi(\mathbf{w}) = \prod_i q_{\phi_i}(w_i)$, where each $w_i$ is a weight and $q_{\phi_i}$ is a univariate distribution (often Gaussian).  This simplifies the computations but can be restrictive.
* **More flexible distributions:**  For more accurate approximations, more complex distributions, such as Gaussian mixtures or normalizing flows, can be used.


### Practical Considerations and Hyperparameter Tuning

Several practical considerations are important when using VI for BNNs:

* **Computational Cost:** VI can still be computationally expensive, especially for large networks and complex variational distributions.
* **Choice of Optimizer and Learning Rate:** Careful selection of the optimizer and learning rate is crucial for efficient convergence.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  The variational distribution's parameters and other hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, prior parameters) need to be tuned to achieve optimal performance.  Techniques like Bayesian optimization can be useful for this purpose.


```\{python}
#| echo: true
# Simplified illustrative example (using PyTorch - requires installation)
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# (Note: This is a highly simplified example and lacks many details of a full BNN implementation)

# Define a simple neural network
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(1, 10)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# ... (Implementation of ELBO calculation and optimization would go here.  
# This would involve defining the variational distribution, computing the expectation
# of the log-likelihood, calculating the KL divergence, and implementing the 
# optimization loop using an optimizer like Adam.) ... 

# Example of a simple optimization loop (incomplete - ELBO calculation missing)
model = Net()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(100):
    # ... (Calculate ELBO and its gradients) ...
    optimizer.step()

```

This code snippet provides a skeletal structure. A complete implementation requires a detailed specification of the variational distribution, the calculation of the ELBO, and the gradient computation and optimization steps, which are complex and beyond the scope of this concise example.  The complete code would require several more lines to implement the actual variational inference process.


## Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation

### Dropout as a Regularization Technique

Dropout is a widely used regularization technique in neural networks. During training, dropout randomly deactivates (sets to zero) a fraction of neurons in each layer with probability $p$. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on any single neuron, forcing it to learn more robust and distributed representations.  The deactivated neurons are re-activated during testing, typically by scaling the weights by $p$.  This prevents the output from being overly attenuated.


### Connecting Dropout to Bayesian Inference

Surprisingly, dropout can be interpreted as an approximation to Bayesian inference.  Consider a neural network with weights $\mathbf{w}$.  Standard dropout can be viewed as approximating the posterior distribution over the weights with a mixture of networks, each with a different subset of weights set to zero.  Specifically,  Gal and Ghahramani (2016) showed that applying dropout during inference is equivalent to approximating the predictive distribution by averaging predictions from an ensemble of networks obtained by randomly dropping out neurons.

Each dropout mask can be considered as a sample from a Bernoulli distribution:

$r_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$

where $r_i$ indicates whether neuron $i$ is active ($r_i = 1$) or inactive ($r_i = 0$), and $p$ is the dropout rate.  The weights after dropout are then:

$\mathbf{w'} = \mathbf{r} \odot \mathbf{w}$

where $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication.

### MC Dropout for Uncertainty Estimation

"MC Dropout" leverages this connection to obtain uncertainty estimates.  Instead of running dropout only during training, we also apply it during testing.  By repeatedly running the network with different dropout masks and averaging the predictions, we can get an approximation of the predictive distribution.  The variance of these predictions provides an estimate of the model's uncertainty.

More formally, we obtain $T$ predictions $\{y_1, y_2, \dots, y_T\}$ by applying dropout repeatedly with different random masks. The mean prediction is given by:

$\bar{y} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T y_t$

And an estimate of the predictive variance can be calculated as:

$Var(y) \approx \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^T (y_t - \bar{y})^2$


### Limitations of Dropout as Bayesian Approximation

While MC Dropout provides a simple and effective way to estimate uncertainty, it has limitations:

* **Approximation Quality:**  The approximation of the true posterior distribution is only valid under specific conditions, such as the assumption of independent dropout masks across layers.  In reality, this assumption is often violated.
* **Overestimation of Uncertainty:** MC Dropout might overestimate the uncertainty, especially for simple tasks.
* **Computational Cost:** Repeatedly running the network with different dropout masks increases the computational cost, especially for large networks.
* **No explicit prior:** MC dropout doesn't explicitly model a prior over the weights, which is a crucial component of Bayesian inference.


```\{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout

# Simplified Example with MC Dropout in TensorFlow/Keras

# ... (Define a Keras model with Dropout layers) ...
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  Dropout(0.5), #Dropout rate of 0.5
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])


# MC Dropout Prediction
def mc_dropout_predict(model, x, T=10):
    y_preds = []
    for _ in range(T):
        y_pred = model(x, training=True) # training=True enables dropout
        y_preds.append(y_pred.numpy())
    return np.mean(y_preds, axis=0), np.std(y_preds, axis=0)

#Example Usage
x_test = np.random.rand(100,10) # Example test data
mean_preds, std_preds = mc_dropout_predict(model, x_test)

# mean_preds and std_preds now contain mean predictions and uncertainty estimates


```

This code shows a simple example of MC Dropout using TensorFlow/Keras.  Remember that this is a basic illustration; a complete implementation would involve training the model and handling potential complexities of real-world datasets.  The `mc_dropout_predict` function showcases the repeated predictions with dropout enabled (`training=True`) to estimate mean predictions and standard deviations representing the uncertainty.


## Practical Applications and Case Studies

### Bayesian Neural Networks for Regression

Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are well-suited for regression tasks where we aim to predict a continuous target variable.  The posterior distribution over the weights allows us to obtain not only a point estimate of the target variable but also a measure of the uncertainty associated with this estimate.  This uncertainty can be crucial in applications where understanding the reliability of predictions is important.  For example, in predicting house prices, a BNN could provide not only the predicted price but also a confidence interval, indicating the range within which the true price is likely to fall.  This can be particularly useful in informing decision-making, as it helps users understand the risk associated with the prediction.

The predictive distribution in regression is given by:

$P(y|x, D) = \int P(y|x, \mathbf{w}) P(\mathbf{w}|D) d\mathbf{w}$

where $y$ is the continuous target variable, $x$ is the input, $D$ is the training data, and $\mathbf{w}$ are the network weights.  The integral is often intractable and approximated using methods like MCMC or VI.


### Bayesian Neural Networks for Classification

In classification tasks, BNNs provide a probability distribution over the classes for a given input.  This probabilistic output is superior to a simple class label, as it explicitly quantifies the uncertainty in the classification.  For instance, in medical image classification, a BNN could assign probabilities to different diagnoses, allowing medical professionals to assess the confidence of the classification and make informed decisions based on the associated uncertainty.  This is particularly helpful when dealing with ambiguous cases or situations with limited data.

The predictive distribution in classification can be expressed as:

$P(C_k|x, D) = \int P(C_k|x, \mathbf{w}) P(\mathbf{w}|D) d\mathbf{w}$

where $C_k$ represents class $k$, and other variables are as defined previously.  Again, the integral is typically approximated using sampling methods.


### Case Study: Implementing a BNN for Time Series Forecasting

Let's consider a time series forecasting task as a case study. We'll use a simple recurrent neural network (RNN) with a Bayesian treatment. The specific task is predicting future values of a univariate time series, such as stock prices.  The choice of a specific RNN architecture, e.g., LSTM or GRU, would depend on the characteristics of the time series data.

**(Note:  A complete implementation of a BNN for time series forecasting is beyond the scope of this short section. This would require a significant amount of code.  We present only a conceptual overview.)**

1. **Data Preparation:**  The time series data would need to be preprocessed (e.g., normalization, splitting into training and test sets).
2. **Model Design:**  An RNN architecture would be chosen (LSTM or GRU).  Each weight in the RNN would have an associated prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian).
3. **Variational Inference:**  A VI method (e.g., using a mean-field approximation with Gaussian variational distributions) would be employed to learn the posterior distribution over the weights.  A library such as Pyro or Edward2 could simplify the implementation.
4. **Prediction and Uncertainty Estimation:**  During inference, multiple samples from the posterior would be used to generate predictions, allowing us to estimate the mean and variance of the predictions at each time step.


### Evaluating Predictive Uncertainty

Evaluating the predictive uncertainty of a BNN is crucial.  Metrics commonly used include:

* **Expected Calibration Error (ECE):** Measures the difference between the predicted confidence and the actual accuracy.
* **Sharpness:** Measures the spread of the predictive distribution.  A wider distribution indicates higher uncertainty.
* **Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL):**  Lower NLL indicates better predictive performance, taking both accuracy and uncertainty into account.  If the model is calibrated and well-specified, lower NLL implies better uncertainty quantification.
* **Visual Inspection:**  Plotting the predictive distribution (e.g., mean and confidence intervals) alongside the true values can give a visual assessment of the model's performance and uncertainty estimates.  This can reveal potential issues, such as over- or under-confidence.

```\{python}
#| echo: true
#Illustrative code snippet (requires libraries like Pyro or Edward2)
# ... (BNN model training and prediction using Pyro or Edward2) ...

#Example of obtaining predictive mean and standard deviation
preds = model(test_data) # assuming model outputs are distributions
mean_preds = preds.mean
std_preds = preds.stddev # or similar access to variance/stddev


# Plotting predictive distribution with confidence intervals
plt.plot(test_data, label='True Values')
plt.plot(mean_preds, label='Mean Predictions')
plt.fill_between(range(len(test_data)), mean_preds - 2*std_preds, mean_preds + 2*std_preds, alpha=0.3, label='95% Confidence Interval')
plt.legend()
plt.show()


```

This code would be part of a larger implementation and demonstrates how to access mean predictions and standard deviations from a BNN’s output to plot predictive distributions with confidence intervals for visualizing predictive uncertainty.  Specific code will depend heavily on the chosen library (Pyro, Edward2, etc.)  Libraries provide methods to directly obtain mean and standard deviation estimates from the predictive distribution.


## Advanced Topics and Further Exploration

### Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Methods for BNNs

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a class of algorithms used to sample from probability distributions.  They are particularly useful for approximating the posterior distribution in Bayesian neural networks, which is often intractable. MCMC methods construct a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the target posterior distribution $P(\mathbf{w}|D)$. By running the chain for a sufficiently long time, we obtain samples from the approximate posterior. These samples can then be used to make predictions and quantify uncertainty.

Popular MCMC methods for BNNs include:

* **Metropolis-Hastings:** A general-purpose MCMC algorithm that accepts or rejects proposed new samples based on the ratio of probabilities.
* **Gibbs Sampling:**  A special case of MCMC where each weight is sampled conditionally on the other weights.  This is often more efficient than Metropolis-Hastings but requires conditional distributions that are easy to sample from.


### Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a more advanced MCMC method that leverages Hamiltonian dynamics to explore the probability distribution more efficiently than simpler methods like random walk Metropolis.  It uses the concept of momentum to guide the sampling process, leading to longer jumps in the sample space and faster convergence.  HMC is particularly useful for high-dimensional problems, such as those encountered in large BNNs, because it avoids the random walk behavior of simpler MCMC methods, which can be very slow in high dimensions.


### Scalable Bayesian Neural Network Training

Training large Bayesian neural networks can be computationally expensive.  Several techniques have been developed to improve scalability:

* **Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI):**  Instead of using the entire dataset to compute the ELBO gradient in VI, SVI uses mini-batches, making it significantly faster for large datasets.
* **Distributed Computing:**  Training can be distributed across multiple machines to speed up computation.
* **Approximation Methods:**  Approximations to the posterior distribution, such as using simpler variational families or low-rank approximations, can reduce computational costs.
* **Hardware Acceleration:** Using GPUs or TPUs significantly accelerates the training process.


### Bayesian Deep Learning Frameworks and Libraries

Several Python libraries provide tools and functionalities for building and training Bayesian neural networks:

* **Pyro:** A probabilistic programming language built on PyTorch.  It offers a flexible and expressive way to define and infer Bayesian models, including BNNs.
* **Edward2:**  A probabilistic programming language built on TensorFlow.  Similar to Pyro, it provides a high-level interface for building and training BNNs.
* **TensorFlow Probability (TFP):**  A library within TensorFlow that provides tools for probabilistic modeling and inference, including methods for training BNNs.
* **PyMC3:**  A library focused on Bayesian modeling using MCMC methods.  While not specifically designed for deep learning, it can be used to build and train BNNs.


```\{python}
#| echo: true
#Illustrative code snippet (using Pyro - requires installation)

import pyro
import pyro.distributions as dist
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple Bayesian neural network using Pyro
class BayesianNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# ... ( Define prior distributions for weights and biases within the model using Pyro) ...
# ... ( Define a guide (variational distribution) for the weights and biases) ...
# ... ( Perform inference using Pyro's SVI or MCMC functionalities) ...

```

This code snippet demonstrates a basic structure for defining a Bayesian neural network using Pyro.  A complete implementation would include defining priors for weights and biases, specifying a variational guide for approximate inference (using VI), and then running the inference algorithm (e.g., using `pyro.infer.SVI`).  The specific implementation details would depend on the chosen inference method (VI or MCMC) and the complexity of the network.  Note that this is a high-level example;  a full implementation would be considerably longer and would require a good understanding of Pyro's functionalities.
