This process leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze the text content and determine the most appropriate class.  The goal is to build a classifier that accurately predicts the class of a new, unseen document based on its learned understanding from a training dataset.  This contrasts with tasks like text generation or translation, which focus on producing new text rather than categorizing existing text. The core of text classification often lies in representing the text data numerically, allowing machine learning models to process and learn from it.  Common representations include bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings.\n\n\n### Types of Text Classification Tasks\n\nText classification encompasses a wide range of tasks, depending on the nature of the categories being assigned. Some common types include:\n\n* **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment expressed in a text (positive, negative, neutral).\n* **Topic Classification:** Assigning a text to predefined topics (e.g., sports, politics, technology).\n* **Spam Detection:** Identifying spam emails or messages.\n* **Genre Classification:** Classifying text into different literary genres (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, poetry).\n* **Language Identification:** Determining the language of a text.\n* **Intent Classification:**  Identifying the user's intent from a text input (e.g., in chatbots).\n\n\n### Applications of Text Classification\n\nText classification finds applications across numerous domains:\n\n* **Customer Service:** Analyzing customer feedback to gauge satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.\n* **Social Media Monitoring:** Tracking public sentiment towards a brand or product.\n* **Healthcare:**  Analyzing patient records to identify trends and risks.\n* **Finance:**  Classifying financial news articles to inform investment decisions.\n* **E-commerce:**  Categorizing product reviews and customer queries.\n\n\nLet's illustrate a simple sentiment analysis example using Naive Bayes, a probabilistic classifier well-suited for text classification. We'll use a small, illustrative dataset.\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n\n# Sample data\ndocuments = ['This is a good movie', 'I hated this film', 'The movie was amazing', 'Absolutely terrible!', 'Pretty good film']\nlabels = ['positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive']\n\n# Create a CountVectorizer to convert text to numerical features\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer()\nX = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)\n\n# Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier\nclf = MultinomialNB()\nclf.fit(X, labels)\n\n# Predict the sentiment of a new document\nnew_document = ['This movie was fantastic']\nnew_X = vectorizer.transform(new_document)\nprediction = clf.predict(new_X)\nprint(f\"Prediction: {prediction[0]}\")\n\n\n#Illustrative Confusion Matrix (requires a larger dataset for meaningful results)\n#This section requires a larger and more realistic dataset for accurate results.  The following is for demonstration only.\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n#Simulated data for a larger dataset\ny_true = np.array(['positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive','positive','negative','positive', 'negative','positive'])\ny_pred = np.array(['positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive','positive','negative','negative', 'negative','positive'])\n\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nsns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', \n            xticklabels=['Positive', 'Negative'], yticklabels=['Positive', 'Negative'])\nplt.xlabel('Predicted')\nplt.ylabel('True')\nplt.title('Confusion Matrix')\nplt.show()\n\n```\n\nThe accuracy of this classifier depends heavily on the size and quality of the training data. The provided code is a simplified demonstration.  More sophisticated techniques, like handling stop words, stemming, and using more advanced feature extraction methods (like TF-IDF or word embeddings), improve classification accuracy significantly.  Furthermore, evaluating model performance rigorously using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC is essential for building robust text classifiers.\n\n\nThe probability of a document belonging to a class *c* given its features *x* is given by Bayes' theorem:\n\n$P(c|x) = \\frac{P(x|c)P(c)}{P(x)}$\n\nwhere:\n\n* $P(c|x)$ is the posterior probability (what we want to compute).\n* $P(x|c)$ is the likelihood (probability of features given the class).\n* $P(c)$ is the prior probability (probability of the class).\n* $P(x)$ is the evidence (probability of the features).  Often treated as a normalizing constant.\n\n\nIn Naive Bayes, we assume feature independence given the class, simplifying the likelihood calculation:\n\n$P(x|c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|c)$\n\n\nThis simplification is a key characteristic of the Naive Bayes approach and makes it computationally efficient, even with high-dimensional data like text.  However, the independence assumption is often violated in reality.  Despite this, Naive Bayes often performs surprisingly well in practice.\n\n\n## Naive Bayes for Text Classification\n\n### The Naive Bayes Algorithm\n\nNaive Bayes is a family of probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.  In the context of text classification, each word (or feature) in a document is considered independent of other words, given the class label.  While this assumption is rarely true in natural language (words often co-occur), the simplicity and efficiency of Naive Bayes often lead to surprisingly good performance.\n\nThe core idea is to calculate the probability of a document belonging to each class and assign the class with the highest probability.  For a document *d* and class *c*, we use Bayes' theorem:\n\n$P(c|d) = \\frac{P(d|c)P(c)}{P(d)}$\n\nSince $P(d)$ is constant for all classes, we can simplify the classification to finding the class *c* that maximizes:\n\n$P(c)P(d|c)$\n\n\n$P(c)$ is the prior probability of class *c* (the proportion of documents belonging to class *c* in the training data).  $P(d|c)$ is the likelihood, the probability of observing document *d* given class *c*.  The \"naive\" assumption comes into play when calculating $P(d|c)$: we assume that the words in *d* are independent given *c*.  Therefore:\n\n$P(d|c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(w_i|c)$\n\nwhere $w_i$ are the words in document *d* and *n* is the number of words. $P(w_i|c)$ is the probability of word $w_i$ appearing in a document of class *c$.\n\n### Text Representation: Bag-of-Words\n\nBefore applying Naive Bayes, we need to represent the text data numerically. A common approach is the bag-of-words model. This model ignores word order and grammar, focusing only on the frequency of each word in the document.  The document is represented as a vector where each element corresponds to the count of a specific word in the vocabulary.\n\nFor example, consider the document \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\".  A bag-of-words representation might look like:\n\n{'the': 2, 'quick': 1, 'brown': 1, 'fox': 1, 'jumps': 1, 'over': 1, 'lazy': 1, 'dog': 1}\n\n### TF-IDF and Term Frequency\n\nWhile bag-of-words is simple, it doesn't consider the importance of words.  TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) refines this by weighing words based on their frequency within a document (TF) and their rarity across the entire corpus (IDF).\n\n* **Term Frequency (TF):**  The number of times a word appears in a document.\n* **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):**  The inverse of the number of documents containing a word.  Words appearing in many documents have low IDF, while rare words have high IDF.\n\nThe TF-IDF score for a word in a document is calculated as:\n\n$TF-IDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) \\times IDF(t)$\n\nwhere:\n\n* $TF(t, d)$ is the term frequency of term *t* in document *d*.\n* $IDF(t) = log(\\frac{N}{n_t})$ where *N* is the total number of documents and $n_t$ is the number of documents containing term *t*.\n\n\n### Implementing Naive Bayes with Python\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data (replace with your own dataset)\ndocuments = [\n    \"This is a positive review.\",\n    \"I hate this product.\",\n    \"This is another positive review.\",\n    \"Terrible service!\",\n    \"A great experience.\"\n]\nlabels = [\"positive\", \"negative\", \"positive\", \"negative\", \"positive\"]\n\n# Create a TF-IDF vectorizer\nvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\nX = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)\ny = np.array(labels)\n\n# Split data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier\nclf = MultinomialNB()\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make predictions on the test set\ny_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate the model\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))\n\n#Confusion Matrix\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\nplt.figure(figsize=(6,4))\nsns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues',xticklabels=['Positive','Negative'], yticklabels=['Positive','Negative'])\nplt.xlabel('Predicted')\nplt.ylabel('True')\nplt.title('Confusion Matrix')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Handling Categorical Features\n\nThe Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier naturally handles count data.  If you have categorical features that are not counts (e.g., colors represented as strings), you need to convert them into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding before applying the classifier.  Scikit-learn's `OneHotEncoder` can be used for this purpose.\n\n\n### Evaluating Model Performance (Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)\n\nWe evaluate the classifier's performance using standard metrics:\n\n* **Precision:** The proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all predicted positive instances.\n* **Recall:** The proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all actual positive instances.\n* **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.  A good balance between precision and recall.\n* **Confusion Matrix:** A table showing the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.\n\n\nThe `classification_report` function in scikit-learn provides these metrics.  The confusion matrix gives a visual representation of the model's performance across all classes.\n\n\n### Addressing the Naive Bayes Assumption\n\nThe naive assumption of feature independence is rarely met in real-world text data.  However, despite this, Naive Bayes often performs well.  Several techniques can help mitigate the impact of this assumption:\n\n* **Using more sophisticated feature extraction:**  Methods like TF-IDF help capture relationships between words to some extent.\n* **Feature selection:**  Removing irrelevant or redundant features can reduce the impact of feature dependence.\n* **Considering alternative Naive Bayes variants:**  There are variations of Naive Bayes, such as Bernoulli Naive Bayes, that might be better suited to certain types of data.  Experimentation is key to determining which variant works best for your specific text classification problem.\n\n\n\n\n## Document Classification\n\n### Preprocessing Text Data (Cleaning, Stemming, Lemmatization)\n\nBefore building a document classifier, preprocessing the text data is crucial for improving model accuracy and efficiency. This involves several steps:\n\n* **Cleaning:** Removing irrelevant characters, such as punctuation, numbers, and special symbols.  Converting text to lowercase is also a standard practice.\n* **Stemming:** Reducing words to their root form (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\").  Stemming algorithms are often heuristic and may not always produce linguistically correct stems.\n* **Lemmatization:**  Reducing words to their dictionary form (lemma), considering the context of the word. Lemmatization usually produces more accurate results than stemming, but it is computationally more expensive.\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport nltk\nimport re\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer\n\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('stopwords')\nnltk.download('wordnet')\n\ndef preprocess_text(text):\n    # 1. Lowercase\n    text = text.lower()\n    # 2. Remove punctuation\n    text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', text)\n    # 3. Tokenize\n    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)\n    # 4. Remove stop words\n    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n    tokens = [w for w in tokens if not w in stop_words]\n    # 5. Stemming (or Lemmatization)\n    stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n    #lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()  #Uncomment for lemmatization\n    #stemmed_tokens = [stemmer.stem(w) for w in tokens]\n    lemmatized_tokens = [stemmer.stem(w) for w in tokens] #Uncomment for lemmatization\n\n    # 6. Join tokens back into string\n    return \" \".join(lemmatized_tokens)\n\ntext = \"This is a sample sentence, with punctuation! and numbers 123.\"\ncleaned_text = preprocess_text(text)\nprint(f\"Original Text: {text}\")\nprint(f\"Cleaned Text: {cleaned_text}\")\n\n```\n\n### Feature Engineering for Document Classification\n\nAfter preprocessing, we need to convert the text into numerical features that machine learning models can understand.  Common approaches include:\n\n* **Bag-of-Words:** As described previously, representing documents as vectors of word frequencies.\n* **TF-IDF:** Weighing words based on their term frequency and inverse document frequency.\n* **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText):** Representing words as dense vectors capturing semantic relationships between words.  These are more advanced techniques that often lead to better performance, but require more computational resources.\n\n\n### Building a Document Classifier with Python\n\nLet's build a simple document classifier using Multinomial Naive Bayes and TF-IDF:\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report\n\n# Sample data (replace with your own dataset)\ndocuments = [\n    (\"This is a sports news article.\", \"sports\"),\n    (\"A new technology has been developed.\", \"technology\"),\n    (\"The political situation is tense.\", \"politics\"),\n    (\"Another sports event is happening.\", \"sports\"),\n    (\"This is a new advancement in technology.\", \"technology\"),\n    (\"Political tensions rise.\", \"politics\")\n]\n\ntexts = [doc[0] for doc in documents]\nlabels = [doc[1] for doc in documents]\n\n# Preprocess the text\npreprocessed_texts = [preprocess_text(text) for text in texts]\n\n# Create a TF-IDF vectorizer\nvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\nX = vectorizer.fit_transform(preprocessed_texts)\ny = np.array(labels)\n\n# Split data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier\nclf = MultinomialNB()\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make predictions\ny_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate the model\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy}\")\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))\n\n```\n\n\n### Case Study: News Article Categorization\n\nA common application of document classification is categorizing news articles into different sections (sports, politics, business, etc.).  This involves collecting a large dataset of news articles, labeled with their corresponding categories, preprocessing the text, building a suitable model (like Multinomial Naive Bayes, or potentially a more sophisticated model like a Support Vector Machine or a deep learning model), and then evaluating its performance on unseen data.  The dataset size significantly impacts the model’s effectiveness.\n\n\n### Evaluating Model Performance on Document Classification\n\nThe evaluation metrics used for document classification are similar to those used for other classification tasks: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.  The choice of metric depends on the specific application and the relative costs of different types of errors.  For instance, in a spam detection system, high recall might be prioritized to minimize the number of spam emails that slip through (false negatives).  A comprehensive evaluation includes examining these metrics for each class to detect potential class imbalances and biases in the model's predictions.  Cross-validation techniques are essential for obtaining robust performance estimates.\n\n\n## Spam Detection using Naive Bayes\n\n### The Challenges of Spam Detection\n\nSpam detection is a challenging text classification problem due to several factors:\n\n* **Constant evolution of spam techniques:** Spammers constantly adapt their methods to circumvent filters.  New techniques emerge regularly, requiring the spam filter to be continuously updated.\n* **High volume of emails:**  Spam filters need to process a large number of emails efficiently.\n* **Subtlety of spam:** Some spam messages are cleverly disguised to look like legitimate emails.\n* **Legitimate emails flagged as spam (false positives):**  This is a critical concern, as users may miss important communications.\n\n\n### Building a Spam Filter using Naive Bayes\n\nA Naive Bayes classifier is a good starting point for building a spam filter due to its simplicity and efficiency. The process involves:\n\n1. **Data Collection:** Gathering a labeled dataset of emails, with each email marked as \"spam\" or \"ham\" (not spam).  This dataset needs to be representative of the emails the filter will encounter.  Public datasets like Enron and SpamAssassin are good resources.\n\n2. **Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the email text.  This includes:\n    * Lowercasing\n    * Removing punctuation and numbers\n    * Removing stop words (common words like \"the,\" \"a,\" \"is\")\n    * Stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their root form)\n\n3. **Feature Extraction:**  Creating numerical features from the preprocessed text.  TF-IDF is a popular choice here.  Additional features beyond word frequencies can be added (see below).\n\n4. **Model Training:** Training a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the features and labels.\n\n5. **Prediction:** Using the trained model to classify new incoming emails as spam or ham.\n\n\n### Handling Email Specific Features\n\nBeyond the text content, email-specific features can significantly improve spam detection accuracy.  These include:\n\n* **Sender's email address:**  Known spam senders can be flagged.\n* **Email headers:**  Headers can contain information about the sender's location, routing information, etc., which can be used for analysis.\n* **Presence of URLs:**  Spam emails often contain many URLs.\n* **Use of special characters:**  Excessive use of special characters can indicate spam.\n* **Length of the email:**  Very short or very long emails might be suspicious.\n\n\nThese features can be incorporated by creating new columns in your feature matrix. For example, you could add a binary feature (0 or 1) indicating whether or not a URL is present.\n\n\n\n### Improving Spam Detection Accuracy\n\nSeveral techniques can be employed to enhance accuracy:\n\n* **Regularly updating the training dataset:** Spam techniques evolve, so retraining the model with new data is crucial.\n* **Using more advanced feature extraction techniques:**  Word embeddings or more sophisticated NLP methods could provide better feature representations.\n* **Ensemble methods:**  Combining multiple classifiers (e.g., using a voting classifier) can often lead to improved performance.\n* **Handling class imbalance:** If the dataset has significantly more ham emails than spam, techniques like oversampling the minority class or using cost-sensitive learning can be beneficial.\n\n\n### Case Study: Building a Spam Classifier with Scikit-learn\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n\n# Load a sample spam dataset (replace with your own dataset)\n#This example uses a simplified, smaller dataset for demonstration.  A real-world application would need a much larger dataset.\ndata = {'text': ['Free Viagra!', 'Meeting at 3pm', 'Win a prize!', 'Project update'], 'label': ['spam', 'ham', 'spam', 'ham']}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n#Preprocessing - simplified for this example\ndf['processed_text'] = df['text'].str.lower()\n\n\nX = df['processed_text']\ny = df['label']\n\n# Create a pipeline for preprocessing and classification\npipeline = Pipeline([\n    ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer()),\n    ('nb', MultinomialNB())\n])\n\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Train the model\npipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make predictions\ny_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate the model\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy}\")\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))\n\n```\n\nRemember to replace the sample dataset with a larger, more realistic dataset for a meaningful evaluation.  The performance of a real-world spam filter heavily depends on the quality and size of the training data and the sophistication of the feature engineering.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques and Considerations\n\n### Beyond Bag-of-Words: N-grams and Word Embeddings\n\nThe bag-of-words model, while simple, ignores word order and contextual information.  More advanced techniques can capture these aspects:\n\n* **N-grams:** Instead of considering individual words, n-grams consider sequences of *n* consecutive words.  For example, bigrams (n=2) capture word pairs like \"machine learning,\" which convey more meaning than individual words.  Trigrams (n=3) consider triplets of words, and so on.  N-grams can improve model performance by capturing local context.\n\n* **Word Embeddings:**  These represent words as dense, low-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning.  Words with similar meanings have vectors that are close together in the vector space.  Popular word embedding models include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.  These embeddings can be used as features in text classification models, often leading to significant improvements in accuracy.  They capture semantic relationships that bag-of-words misses.\n\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec\nfrom nltk import word_tokenize\n\nsentences = [[\"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"sentence\"], [\"this\", \"is\", \"another\", \"sentence\"]]\n\n# Train a Word2Vec model\nmodel = Word2Vec(sentences, min_count=1)\n\n# Get the vector for a word\nvector = model.wv['this']\nprint(f\"Word vector for 'this': {vector}\")\n\n# Find similar words\nsimilar_words = model.wv.most_similar('this')\nprint(f\"Words similar to 'this': {similar_words}\")\n```\n\n### Handling Imbalanced Datasets\n\nIn many text classification tasks, the classes might be imbalanced (one class has significantly more instances than others).  This can lead to biased models that perform poorly on the minority class. Techniques to address this include:\n\n* **Resampling:** Oversampling the minority class (creating synthetic samples) or undersampling the majority class.\n* **Cost-sensitive learning:**  Assigning different misclassification costs to different classes.  This penalizes misclassifying the minority class more heavily.\n* **Ensemble methods:**  Combining multiple models trained on different subsets of the data.\n\n\n### Hyperparameter Tuning\n\nThe performance of a text classification model depends heavily on its hyperparameters (e.g., the number of features in TF-IDF, the smoothing parameter in Naive Bayes).  Hyperparameter tuning involves systematically searching for the optimal hyperparameter settings. Techniques include:\n\n* **Grid search:**  Evaluating all combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined range.\n* **Random search:**  Randomly sampling hyperparameter combinations.\n* **Bayesian optimization:**  Using a Bayesian approach to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space.\n\n\nScikit-learn's `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV` functions facilitate hyperparameter tuning.\n\n\n### Other Classification Algorithms for Text\n\nWhile Naive Bayes is a good starting point, other algorithms can be more effective for text classification:\n\n* **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** Effective in high-dimensional spaces, often performing well with TF-IDF features.\n* **Logistic Regression:**  A simple and efficient linear model.\n* **Random Forest:**  An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees.\n* **Deep Learning Models (Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks):**  Powerful models that can capture complex patterns in text data, but require significant computational resources and large datasets.\n\n\n\n### Future Trends in Text Classification\n\nFuture trends in text classification include:\n\n* **Improved handling of contextual information:**  More sophisticated NLP models that capture long-range dependencies and nuanced contextual information.\n* **Cross-lingual and multilingual classification:**  Building models that can classify text across multiple languages.\n* **Explainable AI (XAI) for text classification:**  Developing methods to understand why a model makes a particular prediction, enhancing trust and transparency.\n* **Addressing bias and fairness in text classification:**  Developing techniques to mitigate biases that may be present in training data.\n* **Incorporating multimodal information:** Combining text with other data modalities, such as images or audio, to improve classification accuracy.\n\n\nThe field of text classification is continuously evolving, driven by advancements in both NLP and machine learning.  The choice of techniques and algorithms will depend on the specific application, available resources, and desired level of accuracy.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"},"output-file":"text-classification.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
