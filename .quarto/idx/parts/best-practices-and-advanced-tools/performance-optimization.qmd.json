Understanding the sources of these bottlenecks is crucial for optimizing code and achieving acceptable runtime performance.  Many Bayesian methods rely on iterative processes like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling or variational inference.  These iterations can involve numerous calculations, making even minor inefficiencies significantly impact overall performance.  Bottlenecks often arise from:\n\n* **Inefficient algorithms:** Choosing an inappropriate algorithm for a given task (e.g., using a slow sampler for high-dimensional problems).\n* **Computational complexity:**  Algorithms with high time complexity (e.g., $O(n^3)$ or worse) become prohibitively slow for large datasets ($n$).\n* **Inadequate data structures:** Using inefficient data structures to store and access data can lead to unnecessary overhead. For example, repeatedly accessing elements within a list compared to a NumPy array.\n* **Unnecessary recomputation:**  Redundant calculations within loops or recursive functions.\n* **Poor vectorization:** Failure to leverage vectorized operations provided by libraries like NumPy.\n\n\n## Profiling Bayesian Python Code\n\nProfiling helps pinpoint the specific parts of your Bayesian Python code that consume the most time. The `cProfile` module in Python's standard library is a valuable tool. It provides detailed statistics on the execution time of each function call.\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport cProfile\nimport pstats\nimport your_bayesian_module # Replace with your module\n\ncProfile.run('your_bayesian_module.your_function(your_arguments)', 'profile_results') #Replace with your function and arguments\n\np = pstats.Stats('profile_results')\np.sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(20) # Show top 20 functions by cumulative time\n```\n\nThis code profiles `your_function` within `your_bayesian_module`. The output shows the functions consuming the most time, allowing you to focus optimization efforts on the most impactful areas.  Other profiling tools like `line_profiler` provide line-by-line execution time analysis, offering even finer-grained insights.\n\n\n## Identifying Computational Hotspots\n\nAfter profiling, you'll identify \"hotspots\"â€”functions or code sections that dominate the runtime.  Visualizing these hotspots can be helpful.  For example, consider a simple Bayesian inference problem where the likelihood calculation is computationally expensive.\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example profiling data (replace with your actual profiling results)\nfunctions = ['likelihood_calculation', 'prior_evaluation', 'posterior_update', 'sampling']\ntimes = [0.8, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.bar(functions, times)\nplt.ylabel('Execution Time (seconds)')\nplt.title('Profiling Results: Function Execution Times')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis generates a bar chart showing the execution time of each function. This visualization clearly shows that `likelihood_calculation` is the primary bottleneck.\n\n\n## Common Sources of Inefficiency\n\n* **Nested Loops:**  Multiple nested loops without vectorization can lead to $O(n^k)$ complexity, where $k$ is the nesting level.  Consider vectorizing using NumPy arrays.\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\n# Inefficient nested loops\nn = 1000\ndata = np.random.rand(n, n)\nresult = np.zeros(n)\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        result[i] += data[i, j]\n\n# Efficient vectorized operation\nresult_vec = np.sum(data, axis=1)  #Much faster\n```\n\n\n* **Unnecessary Re-computation:** Avoid recalculating the same values repeatedly. Store intermediate results or use memoization techniques (e.g., using Python's `functools.lru_cache` decorator).\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)  # Memoize expensive calculations\ndef expensive_function(x):\n    # ... complex calculation ...\n    return result\n```\n\n\n* **Poor use of NumPy:** NumPy's vectorized operations are significantly faster than explicit loops for numerical computations.\n\n\n* **Inefficient Sampling Methods:**  For MCMC, choosing an appropriate sampler is crucial.  For example, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) or No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) are often more efficient than simpler methods like Metropolis-Hastings for high-dimensional problems.\n\n\n* **Lack of Parallelization:** If your computations are independent, leverage multiprocessing or other parallelization techniques to distribute the workload across multiple cores.\n\n\nBy systematically profiling your code, identifying hotspots, and addressing common sources of inefficiency, you can significantly improve the performance of your Bayesian computations, especially when working with complex models or large datasets. Remember to always profile after applying optimization to ensure improvements are actually being made.\n\n\n## Vectorization Techniques\n\nVectorization is a crucial technique for optimizing Bayesian computations in Python.  Instead of processing data element by element using loops, vectorization allows you to perform operations on entire arrays at once. This leverages the optimized underlying implementations of libraries like NumPy, resulting in significant speedups.\n\n### NumPy for Vectorized Bayesian Calculations\n\nNumPy is the cornerstone of efficient numerical computation in Python.  Its arrays provide a highly optimized way to represent and manipulate data, enabling vectorized operations that significantly outperform equivalent loop-based approaches.  For instance, consider calculating the likelihood for a set of data points given a model.  A loop-based approach would be:\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef likelihood_loop(data, mu, sigma):\n    likelihoods = []\n    for x in data:\n        likelihood = (1 / (sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi))) * np.exp(-0.5 * ((x - mu) / sigma)**2)\n        likelihoods.append(likelihood)\n    return np.array(likelihoods)\n\ndata = np.random.randn(10000)\nmu = 0\nsigma = 1\n\n%timeit likelihood_loop(data, mu, sigma)\n```\n\nThe vectorized equivalent using NumPy is far more efficient:\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\ndef likelihood_vectorized(data, mu, sigma):\n    likelihoods = (1 / (sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi))) * np.exp(-0.5 * ((data - mu) / sigma)**2)\n    return likelihoods\n\n%timeit likelihood_vectorized(data, mu, sigma)\n```\n\nThe difference in execution time is substantial, especially for larger datasets.  The vectorized version operates on the entire `data` array simultaneously, avoiding the overhead of Python's loop interpreter.\n\n### Vectorizing Posterior Updates\n\nMany Bayesian methods iteratively update posterior distributions.  Vectorization can drastically speed up these updates. Consider a simple Bayesian linear regression:  Suppose we have a dataset $\\mathbf{X}$ (design matrix) and $\\mathbf{y}$ (response vector), and we want to update the posterior distribution of the regression coefficients $\\mathbf{w}$ using a Gaussian prior. The posterior update involves matrix operations that are naturally vectorized in NumPy.\n\n\nLet the prior be $p(\\mathbf{w}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_0)$, and the likelihood be $p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_n)$.  The posterior is also Gaussian: $p(\\mathbf{w}|\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{\\mu}_n, \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_n)$, where:\n\n$\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_n^{-1} = \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_0^{-1} + \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_n^{-1} \\mathbf{X}$\n\n$\\mathbf{\\mu}_n = \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_n (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_n^{-1} \\mathbf{y})$\n\n\nThese matrix operations are efficiently handled by NumPy:\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport numpy as np\n\n# ... (Define X, y, Sigma_0, Sigma_n) ...\n\nSigma_n_inv = np.linalg.inv(Sigma_0) + X.T @ np.linalg.inv(Sigma_n) @ X\nSigma_n = np.linalg.inv(Sigma_n_inv)\nmu_n = Sigma_n @ (X.T @ np.linalg.inv(Sigma_n) @ y)\n```\n\n\n### Efficient Sampling with Vectorization\n\nSampling from posterior distributions is often a bottleneck in Bayesian inference.  Many samplers can be partially vectorized.  For example, generating samples from a multivariate Gaussian using NumPy's `random.multivariate_normal` is significantly faster than using a loop-based approach.\n\n\n### Avoiding Loops with NumPy\n\nThe key to efficient NumPy usage is to avoid explicit Python loops whenever possible. NumPy functions are designed to operate on entire arrays, allowing for efficient use of underlying optimized C code.  This drastically reduces the interpreter overhead associated with Python loops.  Favor NumPy's built-in functions for element-wise operations, matrix algebra, and other numerical computations.  Replace loop-based code with vectorized NumPy equivalents to drastically improve performance in your Bayesian calculations.\n\n\n## Parallel Processing for Bayesian Inference\n\nBayesian inference, particularly with complex models or large datasets, can be computationally intensive.  Parallel processing offers a powerful approach to accelerate these computations by distributing the workload across multiple CPU cores. This chapter explores how to leverage parallel computing to enhance the efficiency of Bayesian inference using Python.\n\n### Introduction to Parallel Computing\n\nParallel computing involves breaking down a computational task into smaller, independent subtasks that can be executed simultaneously on multiple processors. This can dramatically reduce the overall runtime, especially for tasks that are easily parallelizable.  The two primary approaches are:\n\n* **Multiprocessing:** Utilizes multiple processes, each with its own memory space.  Suitable for CPU-bound tasks (computations that are limited by CPU processing power).\n\n* **Multithreading:** Utilizes multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space.  More efficient for I/O-bound tasks (computations that spend significant time waiting for data input/output).\n\nFor Bayesian inference, multiprocessing is generally preferred because many Bayesian computations are CPU-bound.\n\n\n### Multiprocessing in Python for Bayesian Tasks\n\nPython's `multiprocessing` module provides a straightforward way to parallelize tasks.  It allows you to create multiple processes that can run concurrently.  Here's a basic example of parallelizing a simple Bayesian calculation:\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport multiprocessing\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_posterior(data_chunk):\n    #Perform Bayesian calculation on a chunk of data\n    # ... your Bayesian calculation ...\n    return result\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    data = np.random.rand(10000)  #Example data\n    chunk_size = 1000\n    num_processes = multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=num_processes)\n    data_chunks = np.array_split(data, num_processes)\n    results = pool.map(calculate_posterior, data_chunks)\n    pool.close()\n    pool.join()\n\n    #Combine results\n    combined_results = np.concatenate(results)\n```\n\nThis code divides the data into chunks and processes each chunk in parallel.\n\n\n### Parallelizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\n\nMCMC algorithms are often computationally expensive. Parallelization can significantly accelerate them, although it requires careful consideration of the algorithm's structure and dependencies.\n\nOne common approach is to run multiple independent MCMC chains in parallel.  Each chain explores the posterior distribution independently, providing multiple estimates that can be combined to obtain a more robust result.\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport multiprocessing\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\ndef run_mcmc_chain(data):\n    #Run a single MCMC chain\n    # ... your MCMC sampling code ...\n    return samples\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    data = np.random.randn(1000) # Example data\n    num_chains = 4\n    num_processes = multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=min(num_processes, num_chains))\n    results = pool.map(run_mcmc_chain, [data]*num_chains)\n    pool.close()\n    pool.join()\n\n    #Combine samples from multiple chains\n    all_samples = np.concatenate(results)\n```\n\n\n### Strategies for Parallel Sampling\n\nSeveral strategies exist for parallelizing MCMC sampling:\n\n* **Independent Chains:** Run multiple chains independently.  Useful for assessing convergence and estimating uncertainty.\n\n* **Parallel Tempering:** Uses multiple chains at different temperatures to improve exploration of the target distribution.\n\n* **Parallel Gibbs Sampling:**  Parallelize the updates of different blocks of variables in a Gibbs sampler if they are conditionally independent.\n\n\n\n### Challenges and Considerations in Parallel Bayesian Inference\n\n* **Communication Overhead:**  Transferring data between processes introduces overhead.  Minimize this by ensuring efficient data partitioning and communication strategies.\n\n* **Synchronization:**  Coordinating parallel processes to ensure correct results can be challenging, particularly in complex algorithms.\n\n* **Load Balancing:**  Distributing the workload evenly across processes is crucial for optimal performance.  Uneven distribution can lead to some processes completing much later than others, negating the benefits of parallelization.\n\n* **Debugging:** Debugging parallel code can be more complex than debugging sequential code due to the non-deterministic nature of parallel execution.\n\n\nEfficient parallel Bayesian inference requires careful consideration of algorithm design, data partitioning, and communication strategies. The choice of parallelization technique depends on the specific Bayesian method and the computational resources available. While parallelization offers significant speed improvements, it also introduces additional complexities that need to be addressed effectively.\n\n\n## GPU Acceleration for Bayesian Methods\n\nGraphics Processing Units (GPUs), initially designed for rendering graphics, are now widely used for general-purpose computing due to their massive parallelism.  This makes them ideally suited for accelerating computationally intensive Bayesian methods. This section explores how to leverage GPUs for faster Bayesian inference.\n\n### Introduction to GPU Computing\n\nGPUs contain thousands of cores, allowing for highly parallel execution of computations.  Unlike CPUs, which excel at sequential tasks, GPUs are optimized for performing the same operation on many data points simultaneously. This characteristic is particularly beneficial for Bayesian methods that involve large-scale matrix operations or iterative sampling processes.  To use GPUs, you'll typically need libraries that interface with GPU hardware, such as CUDA or OpenCL.\n\n\n### CUDA and CuPy for Bayesian Calculations\n\nCUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA.  CuPy is a NumPy-compatible array library for CUDA, allowing you to write GPU-accelerated code using a familiar NumPy-like syntax.  This greatly simplifies the transition from CPU-based to GPU-based computations.\n\n\nLet's consider a simple example of matrix multiplication.  A CPU-based implementation using NumPy:\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\n\nA = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)\nB = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)\n\nstart_time = time.time()\nC_cpu = np.matmul(A, B)\nend_time = time.time()\nprint(f\"CPU time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n```\n\nThe equivalent using CuPy on a GPU:\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport cupy as cp\nimport time\n\nA_gpu = cp.random.rand(1000, 1000)\nB_gpu = cp.random.rand(1000, 1000)\n\nstart_time = time.time()\nC_gpu = cp.matmul(A_gpu, B_gpu)\nend_time = time.time()\nC_cpu = cp.asnumpy(C_gpu) # transfer back to CPU for comparison and further use\nprint(f\"GPU time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds\")\n```\n\nYou will need a compatible NVIDIA GPU and CUDA drivers installed for this code to work.  The GPU version is usually significantly faster for large matrices.\n\n\n### Accelerating MCMC with GPUs\n\nMCMC algorithms often involve many repetitive calculations that are highly parallelizable.  GPUs can significantly accelerate these calculations.  For instance, the likelihood evaluation for each sample in Metropolis-Hastings or the gradient calculations in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo can be parallelized.  Libraries like CuPy can facilitate this by allowing you to perform these computations on the GPU.\n\n\n### GPU-Accelerated Variational Inference\n\nVariational inference, another popular Bayesian inference technique, also benefits from GPU acceleration.  Many of the optimization steps involved in variational inference, such as gradient calculations and matrix operations, can be parallelized efficiently using GPUs.  Libraries specifically designed for GPU-accelerated variational inference are emerging, further simplifying the process.\n\n\n\n### Performance Comparisons: CPU vs. GPU\n\nThe speedup achieved by using GPUs varies depending on the specific algorithm, the size of the dataset, and the GPU's capabilities. However, for many Bayesian methods involving large datasets and complex models, GPUs can provide substantial performance improvements, often orders of magnitude faster than CPU-based implementations.\n\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Example data (replace with your actual timings)\nmatrix_sizes = [100, 500, 1000, 2000]\ncpu_times = [0.01, 0.5, 5, 40]\ngpu_times = [0.001, 0.05, 0.5, 4]\n\nplt.plot(matrix_sizes, cpu_times, label=\"CPU\")\nplt.plot(matrix_sizes, gpu_times, label=\"GPU\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Matrix Size\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Execution Time (seconds)\")\nplt.title(\"CPU vs. GPU Performance for Matrix Multiplication\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis chart illustrates a typical scenario:  the GPU's advantage becomes more pronounced as the problem size increases.  The specific speedup will vary based on your hardware and the specific Bayesian method you are implementing.  However, the potential for significant improvements using GPUs is clear.\n\n\n## Advanced Optimization Strategies\n\nBeyond vectorization and parallelization, several advanced techniques can further enhance the performance of Bayesian computations in Python.  These techniques often require a deeper understanding of Python's internals and the specific challenges of Bayesian methods.\n\n\n### Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation\n\nJust-in-time (JIT) compilation translates Python code into machine code during runtime. This can significantly improve performance, particularly for computationally intensive numerical operations.  Numba is a popular JIT compiler that works well with NumPy arrays.\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nfrom numba import jit\nimport numpy as np\n\n@jit(nopython=True) #Enable JIT compilation\ndef bayesian_update_jit(likelihood, prior):\n    # ...your Bayesian update calculations using NumPy...\n    return posterior\n\n# Example usage\nlikelihood = np.random.rand(10000)\nprior = np.random.rand(10000)\nposterior = bayesian_update_jit(likelihood, prior)\n```\n\nThe `@jit` decorator instructs Numba to compile the `bayesian_update_jit` function.  The `nopython=True` argument ensures that the compilation is done in a mode that generates optimized machine code.  This typically results in significant speed improvements compared to pure Python code.\n\n\n### Memory Management Optimization\n\nEfficient memory management is crucial, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex models. Techniques to consider include:\n\n* **Avoid unnecessary copies:**  Minimize data copying operations by using views or in-place modifications whenever possible. NumPy's array slicing allows for creating views without copying the underlying data.\n\n\n* **Use memory-efficient data structures:** Choose appropriate data structures for your data.  For numerical computations, NumPy arrays are generally more efficient than Python lists.  Sparse matrices are advantageous for dealing with datasets with many zero values.\n\n\n* **Pre-allocate memory:**  When working with loops that involve dynamic array resizing, pre-allocate memory for the arrays to avoid repeated memory reallocation, which can be computationally expensive.\n\n\n### Choosing the Right Data Structures\n\nThe choice of data structure has a significant impact on performance.  For numerical computations, NumPy arrays are generally superior to Python lists in terms of speed and memory efficiency.  Sparse matrices, available in libraries like SciPy, are optimized for handling data with a large number of zero values.  Consider these data structures:\n\n* **NumPy arrays:** For dense numerical data.\n\n* **SciPy sparse matrices:** For sparse matrices (mostly zeros).\n\n* **Pandas DataFrames:** For tabular data with mixed data types.\n\nThe optimal choice depends on the characteristics of your data and the operations you perform.\n\n\n### Algorithmic Optimizations for Bayesian Methods\n\nChoosing the most efficient algorithm is paramount.  Consider these factors:\n\n* **Computational complexity:**  Algorithms with lower time complexity ($O(n)$ vs. $O(n^2)$) are crucial for large datasets.\n\n* **Approximations:** In some cases, approximate inference methods (e.g., variational inference) may be significantly faster than exact methods (e.g., MCMC) with acceptable accuracy loss.\n\n* **Specialized algorithms:**  For specific problems, specialized algorithms might offer significant performance gains.\n\n\nBy judiciously applying these advanced optimization strategies, you can further reduce the computational cost of your Bayesian inference tasks, especially when working with large datasets or complex models. Remember to always profile your code to identify the bottlenecks and measure the impact of each optimization technique.\n\n\n## Case Studies: Optimizing Specific Bayesian Models\n\nThis section presents case studies demonstrating performance optimization techniques for specific Bayesian models.  These examples illustrate how the strategies discussed in previous sections can be applied in practice.\n\n### Optimizing Gaussian Process Regression\n\nGaussian Process Regression (GPR) involves inverting a kernel matrix, which has a computational complexity of $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of data points.  This becomes computationally expensive for large datasets.  Several optimization strategies can mitigate this:\n\n* **Sparse approximations:**  Methods like sparse Gaussian processes replace the full kernel matrix with a smaller, sparse approximation, significantly reducing the computational cost.  This reduces the complexity from $O(n^3)$ to something closer to $O(m^3)$, where $m << n$ is the number of inducing points in the sparse approximation.\n\n* **Subset of data:**  Instead of using the entire dataset, a carefully selected subset can be used for training, leading to faster computation with a small loss of accuracy.\n\n\n* **Low-rank approximations:** Techniques like NystrÃ¶m methods approximate the kernel matrix using a low-rank decomposition, reducing computational complexity.\n\n\nConsider a simple GPR implementation (without optimization):\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import RBF\n\nX = np.random.rand(1000, 1)  #Large Dataset\ny = np.sin(X * 6) + np.random.randn(1000, 1) * 0.1\nkernel = RBF()\ngpr = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=kernel)\n%timeit gpr.fit(X, y) #Time the training\n```\n\nApplying a sparse approximation (using GPyTorch, for example, which offers optimized sparse GPR implementations):\n\n```\\{python}\n#| echo: true\n#Code for sparse GPR using GPyTorch would be placed here.\n#This would involve creating a SparseGP model and fitting to the data.\n#The time taken would be significantly lower than the previous example.\n\n#Note:  GPyTorch is not included here because it requires separate installation and a GPU might be needed for optimal performance of the sparse GPR.  Illustrative code is omitted for brevity.\n```\n\nThe difference in runtime between the full GPR and a sparse GPR implementation, especially for larger datasets, will be significant.\n\n\n### Performance Improvements in Bayesian Linear Regression\n\nBayesian linear regression involves updating the posterior distribution of the regression coefficients.  The key performance bottleneck is often the matrix inversion involved in calculating the posterior covariance.  Optimizations include:\n\n* **Vectorization:**  Use NumPy's efficient matrix operations instead of explicit loops for updating the posterior.\n\n* **Pre-computation:** If possible, pre-compute certain parts of the calculation that don't change during the iterations.\n\n\n* **Efficient solvers:** For very large datasets, using efficient linear algebra solvers (e.g., those optimized for sparse matrices) can improve performance.\n\n\n\n### Optimizing Bayesian Neural Networks\n\nBayesian neural networks (BNNs) are computationally expensive, requiring many samples to approximate the posterior distribution of the network weights.  Optimizations include:\n\n* **Variational Inference:**  Use variational inference methods to approximate the posterior, which is often computationally faster than full MCMC sampling.\n\n\n* **Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD):** This method combines stochastic gradient descent with Langevin dynamics, providing a computationally efficient way to approximate samples from the posterior.\n\n\n* **Hardware Acceleration:** GPUs can drastically accelerate the training of BNNs by parallelizing the computations involved in backpropagation and sampling.\n\n\nThe choice of optimization technique depends on the specific BNN architecture, the dataset size, and the desired level of accuracy.\n\n\nThese case studies demonstrate that careful consideration of both algorithmic and implementation details is crucial for efficiently training and utilizing Bayesian models.  The choice of optimization strategy significantly impacts runtime and feasibility, especially for large-scale problems.  Profiling and benchmarking are essential steps to identify bottlenecks and guide the selection of appropriate optimizations.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"},"output-file":"performance-optimization.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
